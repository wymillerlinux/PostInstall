# PostInstall
A shell script that installs stuff after installing your operating system. This just general tools and software that I believe should be installed by default.

## Installation
You have to clone this repo first by: `git clone https://github.com/wymillerlinux/PostInstall` <br>
Then navigate to the directory that the repo was cloned to.

## Running
This works on multiple shells. <br>
Bash: `bash postinstall.sh` <br>
Fish (I use this shell): `fish postinstall.sh` <br>
Zsh: `zsh postinstall.sh` <br>

## Troubleshooting

Q: I don't like the software you put in here! <br>
A: Cool, don't care, however. This is MY installation script and I want to share this with developers.

Q: I wanna help! Where can I start? <br>
A: Awesome! I suck at shell scripting. You can modify the logic and the structure in my script but you can't modify any of the packages I need for development. Just heads up.
